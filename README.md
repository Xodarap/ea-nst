Repository for using neural style transfer neural networks create effective altruism-related images. The Python notebook should be runnable "as is" from Google colab, and pretty easy to run locally via Jupyter once dependencies are installed.

The PDFs in this repository are "brute force" outputs, i.e. they pair every style image with every content image so that I can easily scan and see which pictures look the best.

PR's and forks appreciated!
